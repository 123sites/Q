# ⭐ Quick-Code-Quiz ⭐ # 

## Description ✏️

This was a challenge where I had to create a multiple choice, timed code quiz.  It had to run in the browser. It needed to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code.  There needed to be clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

The functions that it needed were:
1) When the start button is clicked, the timer starts when presented with a question.
2) Points subtracted when there is a wrong answer.
3) When either all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, the game is over.
4) When the game is over, initials and score are saved. 


an application that randomly created a password based on the given criteria.  It runs in the browser. I updated this by using JavaScript.  In addition, this application shows well on a laptop and a cell phone (see below images).

The password generated:
1) Is 8-128 characters long.
2) Confirms whether or not they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
3) The input is validated on the Console and has at least 1 character type selected.
4) Afterwards, the password is displayed and written onto the webpage.
